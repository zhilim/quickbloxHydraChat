quickbloxHydraChat
==================

This is the hydra chat repository using quickblox API

-All it does now is enable calls between two parties alone
-for that purpose there exists only two users on the quickblox cloud server
-signing in is preprogrammed into the buttons on the app (sherlock and john)

-there are still alot of bugs such as crashes when going back screen and calling again while other user is still in session

IMPT: FOR THIS TO WORK ON ECLIPSE ADT EMULATOR, GO TO DEVICE MANAGER AND SET EMULATOR CAMERA TO SIMULATION. the default setting is off.
